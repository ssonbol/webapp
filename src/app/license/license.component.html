    international law. You agree and consent that both the FIIT App and PEMRS
    are not subject to the Rules and Regulations associated with HIPAA or HITECH
    as this App is being directly offered to you for your own personal benefit
    independent from any healthcare or medical services and it is also not being
    offered to you by or on behalf of any independent third-party healthcare
    providers or Covered Entities. PEMRS still follows Applicable Laws,
    Regulations, and Standards related to the protection and privacy of data,
    such as using encryption technologies and processes to ensure the security
    of your Medical Data while it is at rest or in motion. You agree and consent
    that PEMRS may collect, create, receive, transmit, maintain, and otherwise
    use your Medical Data in order to provide you with access to the App and its
    Services. You also agree that unless you consent to this use of Medical
    Data, PEMRS will not provide you with access to the App. PEMRS™only
    collects, creates, receives, transmits, maintains, and otherwise shares
    Medical Data with individuals that you authorize and give consent to through
    the App. 6. Consent to Disclosure of Medical Data in De-Identified Form You
    agree and consent that PEMRS may de-identify and/or anonymize (remove all
    information that could be used to specifically identify you) your Medical
    Data within the App and use that de- identified Medical Data in aggregate or
    non-aggregate forms for research studies, evaluation of the App and our
    services or functionality, quality improvement purposes, or for any other
    lawful commercial purpose in accordance with our Privacy Policy. PEMRS’ use
    and disclosure of any de-identified Medical Data in aggregated or
    non-aggregated forms will be conducted in compliance with all Applicable
    Laws and Regulations. You agree that you consent to such disclosures and
    uses of de-identified Medical Data, and that PEMRS is not obligated to pay
    any amount to you or otherwise compensate you or any other person in any way
    for such disclosures and uses, and that PEMRS is not required to furnish you
    with any other information of any kind regarding such disclosures and uses,
    and to the extent that you have proprietary interest in any such
    de-identified Medical Data, you waive any right to such interest and you
    waive any right to seek compensation for such disclosures or uses. You also
    agree that unless you consent to this use of de-identified Medical Data,
    PEMRS will not provide you with access to the App. 7. Optional Consent to
    Disclosure and Use of Medical Data in Identifiable Form You agree that at
    your own personal discretion, you may also use the FIIT App to provide
    optional authorization and consent for your Medical Data to be shared in
    identifiable forms (with information that could be used to specifically
    identify you). You agree that this optional authorization and consent is not
    a pre-condition or requirement in order to use the App or to receive any
    medical treatment, payment, or benefit for which you may be eligible. You
    agree that you are freely able to use this App and its related services
    without providing this optional authorization and consent, and that you are
    free to revoke your authorization and consent for sharing identifiable
    Medical Data at any time. You agree that if you provide this optional
    authorization and consent, PEMRS may share your identifiable Medical Data in
    aggregate or non-aggregate forms for research studies, evaluation of the App
    and our services or functionality, quality improvement purposes, or for any
    other lawful commercial purpose in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
    PEMRS’ use and disclosure of any identifiable Medical Data in aggregated or
    non-aggregated forms will be conducted in compliance with all Applicable
    Laws and Regulations. You agree that your optional consent allows for such
    disclosures and uses of identifiable Medical Data, and that PEMRS is not
    obligated to pay any amount to you or otherwise compensate you or any other
    person in any way for such disclosures and uses, and that PEMRS is not
    required to furnish you with any other information of any kind regarding
    such disclosures and uses, and to the extent that you have proprietary
    interest in any such identifiable Medical Data, you waive any right to such
    interest and you waive any right to seek compensation for such disclosures
    or uses. 8. No Medical Advice, Treatment, or Diagnosis PEMRS and the App do
    not provide medical advice, treatment, or diagnosis. You acknowledge and
    agree that the App is merely a conduit of Medical Data related to you and
    the provision of healthcare provided to you by independent third-party
    healthcare providers. You agree that those independent third-party
    healthcare providers are solely responsible for and will have complete
    authority, responsibility, supervision, and control over the provision of
    all medical services, advice, instructions, treatment decisions, and other
    professional health care services that are performed. You agree that all
    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other professional healthcare
    services will be provided and performed exclusively by or under the
    supervision of independent third-party healthcare providers as they, in
    their sole discretion, deem appropriate. You acknowledge and agree that
    PEMRS and the App do not provide or endorse any medical advice through the
    App and that no information obtained through the App can be so used. PEMRS
    has and will exercise absolutely no control, authority, or supervision over
    the provision of any medical services or other professional health care
    services. The use of the App, all text, graphics, images, audio content,
    audiovisual content, data, other materials and any other information
    provided on, entered into, or made available through the App, including all
    healthcare related information, whether provided by you or independent
    third- party healthcare providers, is solely yours and their responsibility.
    PEMRS makes all reasonable efforts in accordance with Applicable Laws and
    Agreements to safeguard the integrity and availability of the App and any
    content or information transferred to, from, or available within. However,
    when using the App, information may be transmitted over a medium that may be
    beyond the control and jurisdiction of PEMRS. As a result, PEMRS assumes no
    liability for or relating to the delay, failure, interruption, or corruption
    of any data or other information transmitted in connection the use of the
    App that is reasonably determined to be beyond PEMRS’ direct control. You
    acknowledge and agree that independent third-party healthcare providers are
    solely responsible for all medical services, advice, instructions,
    diagnoses, treatments, procedures, and other services provided in connection
    with using the App or otherwise referencing the content or information
    available within it. 9. Third-Party Access You agree and consent that your
    usage of any of the available methods within the App for sharing access with
    others constitutes your implicit consent and authorization for PEMRS to use
    and make your Personal Data and Medical Data available to others in
    accordance with those methods and your inputs, as well as the terms and
    conditions of our Agreements. You are solely responsible for ensuring the
    accuracy and validity of the contact information of recipients whom you
    grant access to your FIIT PHR. PEMRS is not responsible for the disclosure
    of Medical Data to recipients based on incorrect, erroneous, or invalid
    contact information submitted by you through the Application. You can use
    the FIIT App to grant more limited access to recipients, such as providing
    access only to specific documents in your PHR, providing access that expires
    after a set amount of time, and other settings as made available within the
    App. 10. Access to Software by Minors The Children’s Online Privacy and
    Protection Act requires that online service providers, which are
    consistently accessed by children under the age of 13 years old, obtain
    parental consent before they collect personally identifiable information
    online from these children. PEMRS™ does not knowingly collect data from
    children under the age of 13, and our App is not directed at users under the
    age of 13. You acknowledge and agree that children under the age of 13 are
    prohibited from using our software. A parent, guardian, or personal
    representative may use the Software on behalf of a child under the age of
    13. You acknowledge and agree that minors between the ages of 13 and 17 may
