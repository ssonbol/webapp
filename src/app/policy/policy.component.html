    the different actions you performed, and the IP address you used to access
    pages on the Website or the FIIT Website. We use this information to

    to purchase our products and services. Retargeting cookies also are used to
    present you with PEMRS on other websites based on your interaction with the

    cookies to help us analyze how visitors use the Website and the FIIT
    Website. The information generated by the cookie about your use of the
    Website and the FIIT Website is generally transmitted to and stored on a
    Google server in the United States. In case of activation of IP
    anonymization, Google will, however, truncate/anonymize the last eight-bit
    segment of your IP address beforehand within Member States of the European
    Union or other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only
    in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google
    server in the United States and truncated there. On behalf of the operator
    of the Website and the FIIT Website, Google will use this information for
    the purpose of evaluating your use of the Website and the FIIT Website,
    compiling reports on Website and FIIT Website activity, and providing the
    operator with other services relating to the Website, the FIIT Website, and

    protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner consistent
    with this policy. We may share aggregate or anonymous information in various
    formats with trusted third parties, and may work with those entities to do
    research and provide products and services, as permitted by laws and our

    websites such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube, and may use
    social media plugins (such as the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button) to
    facilitate social media functions. When you visit the Website or the FIIT
    Website the operator of a social media plugin may set cookies or other
    tracking technology on your browser, enabling that social media operator to
    recognize individuals who visit the Website, the FIIT Website. If you are
    logged into a social media website while browsing on the Website or the
    PEMRS Website, the social media plugins may allow the social media website
    to receive information about your visit, including the pages that you
    viewed, and connect the visit to your user Information. The social media
    plugins also allow the social media website to share information about your
    activities on the Website, the FIIT Website with other users of their social
    media website. For example, Facebook social media plugins allow Facebook to

    media website&#39;s privacy policy, so we encourage you to use care and

    working with us may handle the processing of customer service, data
    management, e-mail distribution, market research, information analysis,
    promotions management, social media marketing, and similar services. We also
    may use cloud service providers to host the Services and store data, and
    these service providers inform us that they apply security measures they
    consider adequate for the protection of the information within their system.
    They have access to user Information needed to perform their functions.  We

    Information will be deleted from the FIIT Portal in ninety (90) days; any
    such user Information already transferred from the Portal into your
